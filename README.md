# Breast Lesion Segmentation Model using DenseNet-121 & U-Net

The purpose of this project is to build a model to segment breast lesions in mammography images. The architecture of the model consists of DenseNet-121, which is used for feature extraction, followed by U-Net for subsequent learning. The scores of this model was compared with that of the baseline model, U-Net.
